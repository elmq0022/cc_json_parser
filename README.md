# Coding Challenges - JSON Parser
This is my solution to the JSON parser challenge found [here](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser/)

## Background
JSON is used to serialize and transfer data in **lots** of APIs.  So, just how hard is it to validate a JSON payload?

## Key Learnings

1. JSON is a context free grammar and can be easily parsed with a recursive descent parser. 

## Extending the Project

1. Implement with a [pushdown automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton) instead of a recursive descent parser.
2. Rewrite the algorithm in a more efficient language like C or Rust and learn how to integrate that code with python.
